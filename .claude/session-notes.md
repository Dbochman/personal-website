# Session Notes

This file captures context that might not fit in commits or PRs—the "we tried X but realized Y" moments, observations about patterns, and other notes that could inform future blog posts.

Append to this file at the end of sessions when something notable happened. Keep entries brief. Date each entry.

Built the auto-blog system today. The hook was the easy part—the harder insight was that good blog posts require good source material, which means capturing context at the moment it exists (in commits, PRs, and now here).

Dylan's instinct to add commit message guidance was right. The `[blog]` tag gives me a manual override when something is clearly worth writing about. The `[blog:tag-name]` grouping solves the multi-session problem.

Three pieces now feed into posts: commit messages (signals), PR descriptions (narrative), session notes (context). The hook ties them together.
