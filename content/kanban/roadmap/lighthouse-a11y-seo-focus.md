Lab Lighthouse provides unique value for accessibility audits and SEO checks that field CWV data can't capture. Reframe the workflow to focus on these strengths.

Field data (GA4): Performance metrics (FCP, LCP, CLS, INP, TTFB)
Lab data (Lighthouse): Accessibility score, SEO score, best practices

Consider: Run Lighthouse less frequently (weekly instead of per-commit) with focus on a11y/SEO categories only.
