I had an idea: what if the blog wrote itself? Not the content—that still requires reflection on actual work. But the prompting. The "hey, we've done a lot, maybe we should write about it" nudge that turns accumulated commits into documentation.

So Claude and I built a hook that does exactly that. Then we realized the hook was only half the problem.

## The Problem

Writing is easy to skip. There's always another feature to build, another bug to fix, another thing that feels more urgent than reflection. The commits pile up, and eventually the work becomes too distant to write about compellingly.

But there's a second problem: even when you remember to write, you need material. Commit messages say what changed, not why. They don't capture the dead ends, the pivots, the moments when a question reframed the entire problem.

The interesting parts of a story evaporate if you don't capture them when they happen.

## The Hook

Claude Code has a hook system. Hooks are scripts or prompts that run in response to events—before tools execute, after sessions end, when certain conditions are met.

I created a `Stop` hook. When Claude is about to finish a session, the hook checks:

1. How many commits have been made since the last blog post?
2. How many of those are "significant" (features, performance improvements, refactors)?

If the count hits 10 commits, or if there are 2+ significant commits, the hook fires. It injects a system message telling Claude to:

1. Read the style guide
2. Analyze recent commits
3. Draft a post about what we accomplished
4. Auto-commit the draft

The configuration lives in `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "type": "prompt",
        "prompt": "Check if a blog post should be written. Count commits since last blog post... If 10+ commits exist OR 2+ significant commits, then: 1) Read docs/BLOG_STYLE_GUIDE.md, 2) Analyze recent commits, 3) Auto-draft a post, 4) Auto-commit the draft.",
        "timeout": 60
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Why the Hook Is Not Enough

After building the hook, I asked myself: what changes could we make to PRs and commits to produce better blog posts later?

The hook can only work with what exists. If commit messages are terse and PR descriptions are mechanical, the hook will fire and Claude will have nothing interesting to say. "We made 10 commits that fixed things" is not a blog post.

The insight was that Claude writes the PR descriptions. Claude has context at the moment of writing that won't exist later. If we capture the narrative then, future Claude has material to work with.

## The Commit Message Guide

PR descriptions capture the full narrative, but commit messages are still useful signals. I added guidance for writing commits that serve as blog source material.

The key additions:

1. **Bodies for non-trivial commits**: Instead of just `fix: Update CMS config`, add context about what we were trying and why.

2. **The `[blog]` tag**: For commits that have a story, add `[blog]` to the subject line:

```
feat: Switch blog content from .mdx to .txt files [blog]

The MDX plugin was transforming files before we could load them raw.
I suggested using a file type no plugin would touch. .txt files
bypass the entire processing pipeline.

This is a workaround that became architecture.
```

The `[blog]` tag tells the hook this commit is worth expanding on, even if the count threshold hasn't been reached. It's a manual override for when we know something is interesting.

### Grouping Across Sessions

Some features span multiple sessions. For these, we use `[blog:tag-name]`:

```
fix: Update CMS config [blog:cms-auth]
fix: Add redirect for /editor [blog:cms-auth]
```

When Claude drafts a post about CMS authentication, it can search for all commits with the same tag and find the full story, even if it happened over days.

## Session Notes

Some context doesn't fit in commits or PRs—the observations, the "we tried X but realized Y" moments, the questions that came up but weren't resolved.

For this, I added `.claude/session-notes.md`. At the end of sessions where something notable happened, Claude appends a brief entry. Less formal than a blog post, more durable than conversation memory.

The hook now checks session notes for additional context when drafting posts.

## Post Interlinking

Blog posts don't exist in isolation. When the CMS post mentions "testing," it could link to the runbook post. When a new post discusses "reframing vs iterating," it could link to where we first explored that pattern.

The style guide now includes guidance for finding and adding these internal links. The hook prompts Claude to scan existing posts for interlinking opportunities before drafting.

Links should feel natural. If one interrupts the flow, skip it. But when a reader might benefit from seeing a related post, the link should be there.

## The PR Style Guide

I added a section to `CLAUDE.md` that changes how Claude writes PR descriptions. The key addition is a "Journey" section:

```markdown
## The Journey
[This is the blog material. Capture:]
- What problem we were trying to solve
- What we tried first (especially if it didn't work)
- The pivot moment—what question or reframe led to the solution
- Why the final approach works
```

The difference matters. Instead of:

```markdown
## Summary
Fix CMS authentication

## Changes
- Updated config to use git-gateway
- Added redirect for /editor route
```

Claude now writes:

```markdown
## Summary
Fix CMS authentication by redirecting to Netlify subdomain

## The Journey
CMS login was returning 405 on the custom domain. We tried:
1. Switching to git-gateway backend (didn't help)
2. Adding Netlify Identity widget explicitly (didn't help)
3. Various API URL configurations (didn't help)

Six commits, each a hypothesis, each wrong. The actual problem was
infrastructure: Cloudflare proxies the custom domain, intercepting
/.netlify/identity/* requests before they reach Netlify.

I noticed it worked on the .netlify.app subdomain. The fix was
accepting the constraint: redirect /editor to the subdomain where
auth actually works.
```

That PR description is already a blog post outline. When the hook fires, Claude reads the PR, and the story is there.

## The Blog Style Guide

The third piece is `docs/BLOG_STYLE_GUIDE.md`—a reference for how Claude should write posts in our voice. It covers:

- **Pronouns**: "I" for Claude's actions (when Claude is the author), "we" for joint work, "Dylan" for my contributions
- **Tone**: Analytical, honest about limitations, dry humor from observation
- **Structure**: Opening attribution, engaging titles, "The Journey" arc, pithy takeaways
- **What to capture**: Dead ends, pivots, the gap between "works visually" and "works correctly"

When the hook fires, Claude reads this guide first. It keeps the voice consistent even when posts are written weeks apart.

## The Full System

The pieces work together:

1. **During work**: Claude writes commit messages with context in the body, marks notable ones with `[blog]`, and groups multi-session features with `[blog:tag-name]`
2. **At PR time**: Claude writes descriptions with "The Journey" section, capturing narrative while context is fresh
3. **At session end**: Claude adds notes to `.claude/session-notes.md` if something notable happened
4. **At session end**: The Stop hook checks commit count, significance, `[blog]` tags, and grouped commits
5. **If threshold met**: Hook prompts Claude to draft a post
6. **Drafting**: Claude reads the style guide, analyzes commits/PRs/session notes, scans for interlinking opportunities, finds the through-line
7. **Output**: Auto-committed draft in `content/blog/` with internal links, ready for the next push

The hook handles attention. The commit messages provide signals. The session notes capture context. The PR template provides narrative. The style guide maintains voice. The interlinking connects the pieces.

## Why "Stop" Hook?

The timing matters. A `Stop` hook runs when Claude is about to finish a session, which means:

- Full context of what we just worked on
- The work is fresh enough to write about meaningfully
- It's a natural pause point for reflection

Running at push-time would be too frequent. Running at session-start would be too late—the work would be in the past.

## The Threshold

I settled on 10 commits as the fallback, with 2+ significant commits as an earlier trigger.

Why 10? Enough to have substance, not so much that the post becomes a laundry list. A good post has a through-line. Ten commits usually provides one.

Why significant commits as an override? A single feature might be worth writing about even at 3 commits. The conventional prefixes (`feat:`, `perf:`, `refactor:`) are a reasonable proxy for intentional, scoped work.

## The Meta Layer

There's something recursive about this. I'm writing about building a system to remind Claude to write, and the system includes templates for how Claude should capture context so it has something to write about.

But recursion isn't the same as absurdity. The bottleneck on documentation is attention and material. This system addresses both:

- The hook shifts attention toward writing at appropriate moments
- The PR template captures material when context exists
- The style guide ensures consistency across time

Whether the writing is good depends on whether there's something worth saying. The system can't manufacture substance. It can only ensure that substance, when it exists, doesn't go undocumented.

## What This Post Is Not

This post wasn't triggered by the hook. We hadn't hit the threshold yet.

I asked Claude to write about it because we'd just built the system and the meta-commentary was too good to skip. Future posts may be hook-prompted. You won't be able to tell the difference, because the process is the same either way.

That's probably the point.

*The system is live. The hook watches commits. The PR template captures journeys. The style guide maintains voice. Now we wait for the work to accumulate.*
