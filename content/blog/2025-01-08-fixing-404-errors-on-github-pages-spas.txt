# Fixing 404 Errors on GitHub Pages SPAs

My automated console error tests started failing. The site worked fine visually, but every blog route was returning a 404 before redirecting to the correct page.

This is a known limitation of single page applications on static hosts. GitHub Pages only serves static files. When a user navigates directly to `/blog/some-post`, there is no file at that path. GitHub returns a 404, the custom 404.html redirects to the SPA, React Router takes over, and the page renders correctly.

The user sees the right content. The console logs an error. Monitoring systems see a failure.

## Why This Matters

Console errors are signal. They indicate something is not working as expected, even if the visible behavior is correct.

For this site specifically:

- Automated tests were flagging failures on every blog page
- Search engines see the initial 404 response
- The redirect chain adds latency to initial page loads
- Details like this are visible to anyone who opens developer tools

If the site is meant to demonstrate operational thinking, the console should be clean.

## The Fix

The solution is pre-rendering. Generate static HTML files for each route at build time so GitHub Pages can serve them directly.

I wrote a build script that:

- Discovers all blog posts from the content directory
- Starts a local preview server
- Uses Playwright to visit each route in a headless browser
- Waits for React to render
- Saves the fully rendered HTML to the appropriate path in the build output

The result is a static HTML file at `/blog/some-post/index.html` that GitHub Pages serves with a 200 response. React hydrates on top of it and takes over routing from there.

## Implementation Details

The script uses Playwright because it was already in the project for end-to-end testing. Adding it to the build pipeline required one additional step in GitHub Actions to install the browser dependencies.

Directory structure follows GitHub Pages conventions. A route like `/blog/some-post` needs a file at `dist/blog/some-post/index.html`.

Build time increased slightly due to Playwright startup and rendering. For a small number of routes, this is negligible.

## Results

Before: 404 response, redirect, then 200. Console error logged.

After: Direct 200 response. Clean console. All eight console error tests passing.

The pre-rendered HTML files are roughly 57KB each, containing the full rendered content. Search engines now see complete pages on initial request.

## What This Demonstrates

This is a small example of treating symptoms as signals rather than noise.

The site "worked" before the fix. A pragmatic response would be to filter 404s out of the test suite and move on. That approach hides the problem instead of solving it.

The fix required understanding the actual behavior of the system, not just the visible outcome. Static hosting has constraints. Client-side routing has tradeoffs. Pre-rendering bridges the gap.

For a portfolio site, the specifics matter less than the approach: notice the problem, understand the root cause, fix it properly.

## Takeaway

If something logs an error, it is worth understanding why.

The distinction between "works visually" and "works correctly" is often where reliability problems hide.
