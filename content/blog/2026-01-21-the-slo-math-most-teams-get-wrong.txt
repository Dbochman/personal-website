"We need four nines."

I've heard this in planning meetings at Spotify, HashiCorp, and Groq. Someone picks 99.99% because it sounds professional. Then reality hits: the on-call engineer takes 15 minutes to acknowledge a page, another 20 to diagnose the issue, and 30 more to fix it. That's over an hour of downtime per incident.

With a 99.99% SLO, your entire monthly error budget is 4.3 minutes. One incident and you're blown.

## Why most 99.99% SLOs fail

Most teams set service level objectives like this:

1. Pick a target that sounds good (99.9%, 99.95%, 99.99%)
2. Calculate the error budget
3. Hope they can stay within it
4. Miss the target
5. Either ignore it or argue about whether the SLO was "realistic"

This is backwards. Your SLO should be derived from your actual capabilities, not from wishful thinking.

## What actually determines your achievable SLO

For availability-based SLOs, your achievable target is primarily a function of:

1. **How quickly you respond to incidents** (MTTR - Mean Time to Recovery)
2. **How many incidents you have** (frequency)

Other factors matter too—detection time, partial degradations, and request-based SLIs can complicate the picture—but for most teams, MTTR and incident count are the dominant variables. Get these wrong and no amount of sophistication elsewhere will save you.

If your mean time to recovery is 45 minutes and you have 2 incidents per month, you're burning 90 minutes of downtime monthly. In a 30-day month (43,200 minutes), that's:

```
(43,200 - 90) / 43,200 = 99.79%
```

Your achievable SLO is approximately 99.8%. Setting a target of 99.95% means you're committing to something you structurally cannot deliver without changing your incident response or reducing incident frequency.

## How to calculate an SLO from MTTR

MTTR isn't one number. It's the sum of several phases, each with different improvement levers:

| Phase | What it measures | Typical range |
|-------|------------------|---------------|
| Detection | Time from failure to alert firing | 1-5 min |
| Acknowledgment | Time from alert to human response | 2-15 min |
| Diagnosis | Time to identify root cause | 5-30 min |
| Remediation | Time to implement fix | 10-60 min |

**Example: A well-tuned team**

- Detection: 2 minutes
- Acknowledgment: 5 minutes
- Diagnosis: 10 minutes
- Remediation: 15 minutes
- **Total MTTR: 32 minutes**

**Example: A struggling team**

- Detection: 5 minutes
- Acknowledgment: 15 minutes (on-call was in a meeting)
- Diagnosis: 20 minutes (logs were hard to find)
- Remediation: 30 minutes
- **Total MTTR: 70 minutes**

Same number of incidents, dramatically different achievable SLO.

## The SLO calculation formula

For a monthly availability SLO with `n` incidents and MTTR of `m` minutes:

```
Achievable SLO = 1 - (n × m) / 43,200
```

**Worked example:** Your team has 3 incidents per month with an average MTTR of 65 minutes.

```
Downtime = 3 × 65 = 195 minutes
Achievable SLO = 1 - (195 / 43,200) = 99.55%
```

Setting a 99.9% target would require either cutting MTTR to 14 minutes or reducing incidents to 1 per month.

### Quick reference: SLO vs incident tolerance

| Incidents/month | MTTR | Achievable SLO | Error budget |
|-----------------|------|----------------|--------------|
| 1 | 30 min | 99.93% | 30 min |
| 1 | 60 min | 99.86% | 60 min |
| 2 | 30 min | 99.86% | 60 min |
| 2 | 60 min | 99.72% | 120 min |
| 4 | 45 min | 99.58% | 180 min |

The relationship is linear. Halving your MTTR or halving your incident count has the same effect on your achievable SLO.

## Which lever to pull: MTTR vs incident frequency

When your achievable SLO doesn't meet business requirements, you have two options:

**Reduce MTTR** by improving:
- Alerting coverage and thresholds (detect faster)
- On-call responsiveness and tooling (acknowledge faster)
- Observability and runbooks (diagnose faster)
- Automation and rollback capabilities (fix faster)

**Reduce incident frequency** by improving:
- Testing and CI/CD quality gates
- Capacity planning and load testing
- Dependency management and circuit breakers
- Architecture and blast radius reduction

Both matter. But MTTR improvements often have faster ROI because they're process changes, not architectural changes. You can improve ack time this week; reducing incident frequency usually takes months.

## Setting honest SLOs: A practical approach

Here's the process I recommend:

1. **Measure your current MTTR** by phase. If you don't have data, use conservative estimates and commit to measuring.

2. **Count your incidents** over the past 3-6 months. Normalize to monthly.

3. **Calculate your achievable SLO** using the formula above, or [use the calculator](/projects/slo-tool).

4. **Set your target 0.05-0.1% below achievable**. If you can achieve 99.85%, target 99.8%. This gives you room for worse-than-average months.

5. **Identify improvement levers** if the achievable SLO doesn't meet business needs. Be specific: "We need to reduce ack time from 12 minutes to 5 minutes" is actionable. "We need to improve reliability" is not.

## Making error budgets useful

Once you have an honest SLO, error budgets become useful instead of fictional.

At 99.8% monthly, you have 86.4 minutes of budget. That's real. You can make decisions against it:

- "This deployment has risk. Do we have budget to absorb a potential 20-minute incident?"
- "We've used 60 minutes this month. Let's slow down on risky changes."
- "We're consistently under budget. We could take on more feature velocity."

Error budgets only work when the SLO reflects reality. A 99.99% target that you consistently miss teaches your team to ignore SLOs entirely.

## SLO Calculator walkthrough

I built an [SLO Calculator](/projects/slo-tool) that does this math for you. It has three modes:

**"What can I achieve?"** - Enter your response times by phase and incident frequency. It calculates your realistic SLO ceiling.

**"Can I meet this SLO?"** - Enter a target and your current capabilities. It tells you whether the math works and what would need to change.

**"Budget Burndown"** - Visualize how your error budget depletes over a period based on simulated incidents.

The first tab is the most useful starting point. It forces the conversation to start from capabilities rather than aspirations.

## Frequently asked questions

**How many incidents can we have at 99.9%?**

At 99.9% monthly, you have 43.2 minutes of error budget. Divide by your MTTR. With 30-minute MTTR, that's 1.4 incidents. With 60-minute MTTR, that's 0.7 incidents—meaning even one typical incident blows your budget.

**What's the difference between SLO and SLA?**

An SLO (Service Level Objective) is an internal target. An SLA (Service Level Agreement) is a contractual commitment with consequences for missing it. Your SLO should be stricter than your SLA to give you buffer before breaching contracts.

**Should we use time-based or request-based SLOs?**

Request-based SLOs (e.g., 99.9% of requests succeed) are more precise but harder to reason about for incident response. Time-based SLOs are simpler for operational planning. Many teams use both: request-based for API services, time-based for user-facing availability.

## The uncomfortable truth

Most teams can't actually achieve 99.99% availability. The math doesn't support it unless you have:

- Sub-minute detection
- Immediate acknowledgment (follow-the-sun coverage or automated response)
- Pre-diagnosed issues (comprehensive runbooks)
- Automated remediation

That's a significant investment. For many services, 99.9% is a more honest target—and hitting a realistic target consistently builds more trust than missing an aspirational one.

The goal isn't the highest number. It's the most accurate one.
