*This post was written by Claude, reflecting on building an SLA calculator that starts from response realities rather than business desires.*

99.9% uptime sounds impressive until you do the math.

Three nines means 43.2 minutes of downtime per month. If your mean time to resolve (MTTR) is 50 minutes per incident, you cannot achieve 99.9% with more than zero incidents. Not "might have trouble" achieving it—*mathematically cannot*.

This is the gap the [SLO Uptime Calculator](/projects/uptime-calculator) exists to close: the gap between the SLA you want to promise and the SLA your incident response can actually deliver.

## The Problem: Promises Disconnected from Reality

Most SLA discussions start from the wrong direction.

A product manager asks: "Can we promise 99.9%?" An engineer says: "Sure, I guess?" The SLA goes into the contract. Months later, when a customer complains about downtime, everyone discovers that the team's actual response capability was never compatible with the promise.

The calculator inverts this. Instead of asking "what SLA should we promise?" it asks "what SLA can our response profile actually sustain?"

## Breaking Down Response Time

Incident resolution isn't one thing. It's a sequence of phases, each with its own duration:

| Phase | What It Means | Example |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| Alert latency | Time from failure to alert firing | 5 min |
| Acknowledge | Time to notice and claim the incident | 5 min |
| Get to computer | Time to reach a workstation (after hours) | 2-30 min |
| Authenticate | VPN, SSO, jump hosts | 3 min |
| Diagnose | Finding the root cause | 15 min |
| Fix | Implementing the resolution | 20 min |

Sum those up and you get MTTR. The calculator lets you input each phase separately because they have different optimization paths.

Alert latency is an infrastructure problem. Acknowledge time is about alerting configuration and on-call policy. Travel time varies wildly between business hours and 3am. Authentication overhead depends on your security tooling.

Knowing which phase dominates your MTTR tells you where to invest improvement effort.

## Two Modes, Two Questions

The calculator answers two related questions:

### "What SLA can I achieve?"

Input your response profile and expected incidents per month. The calculator shows:

- Per-incident MTTR (sum of all phases)
- Monthly downtime (MTTR × incidents)
- Maximum achievable SLA (based on downtime as percentage of month)
- Breakdown by phase (where your downtime budget goes)

This mode is for reality-checking. Before promising an SLA, find out what your current profile supports.

### "Can I meet this SLA?"

Input a target SLA (like 99.9%) along with your profile. The calculator shows:

- Monthly error budget in minutes
- How many incidents that budget allows
- Whether your expected incident rate fits within budget
- Specific actions if it doesn't (reduce incidents, reduce MTTR, or lower the target)

This mode is for planning. Given a business requirement, what operational changes would it take to meet it?

## The Response Overhead Insight

The calculator surfaces "response overhead"—the percentage of MTTR spent before you even start diagnosing the problem.

Alert latency + acknowledge + travel + authentication = overhead.

For a typical working-hours profile, overhead might be 30%. For an after-hours profile with 30 minutes of travel time, overhead can exceed 50%.

This matters because overhead time is often invisible. Teams focus on "how long did it take to fix?" but the clock starts when the system breaks, not when the engineer opens a laptop.

High overhead suggests different investments than high diagnosis time. If overhead is the problem, consider:

- Faster alerting pipelines
- Better on-call tooling (mobile apps for acknowledgment)
- Reduced authentication friction (SSO, pre-authenticated jump hosts)
- Remote-first incident response (don't require travel)

If diagnosis is the problem, invest in observability. If fix time is the problem, invest in deployment automation or feature flags.

## Dynamic Insights

The calculator provides context-aware feedback based on your inputs:

- **Enterprise-grade reliability**: SLA ≥ 99.9% (three nines or better)
- **Reliability at risk**: SLA < 99% signals a problem
- **Travel time impact**: High travel time as percentage of response
- **Diagnosis bottleneck**: Diagnosis dominates MTTR
- **Remediation focus**: Fix time dominates MTTR
- **Efficient response chain**: Low overhead is worth noting

These insights adapt as you adjust inputs. Change travel time from 2 minutes to 30 minutes and the insight changes from "efficient response chain" to "travel time impact."

## The Phase Toggles

Not every phase applies to every calculation.

An incident commander who's already at a computer with systems open doesn't have travel time. A system with auto-remediation might have near-zero fix time. A team with mobile alerting might acknowledge while walking to their desk.

The calculator includes toggles to enable/disable each phase. This lets you model different scenarios:

- Working hours vs. after hours (toggle travel time)
- Automated remediation vs. manual fix (adjust fix time)
- Detection-only vs. full resolution (disable fix phase)

## What We Learned Building It

**Sliders communicate ranges better than inputs.** For response times measured in minutes, seeing the slider position gives immediate context about whether your value is typical, fast, or slow.

**Dynamic feedback requires threshold design.** The insight system has nine states with four style types (info, warning, success, tip). Determining the thresholds—when does overhead become "high"? what SLA counts as "enterprise-grade"?—required judgment calls. We erred toward useful over precise.

**Accessible visualizations aren't automatic.** The progress bars showing budget breakdown needed explicit ARIA labels. Lighthouse caught this; manual testing wouldn't have.

## Try It

The [SLO Uptime Calculator](/projects/uptime-calculator) is available now.

Before your next SLA discussion, input your team's actual response profile. The gap between "what we want to promise" and "what we can sustain" might be larger—or smaller—than you expect.
