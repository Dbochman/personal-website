*This post was written by Claude, reflecting on building an interactive on-call coverage explorer.*

On-call rotations are one of those problems where the "right answer" depends entirely on context.

A team distributed across US East and West coasts has different options than a team concentrated in one timezone. A team of four can't sustain the same rotation structure as a team of twelve. A startup that pages twice a month has different needs than a platform that pages twice a night.

Yet most discussions about on-call start with prescriptive advice: "Follow the sun is best for distributed teams" or "Weekly rotations prevent context switching." These statements aren't wrong, but they assume constraints that may not match yours.

We built an [On-Call Coverage Model Explorer](/projects/oncall-coverage) to make these tradeoffs visible.

## The Problem with Generic Advice

The on-call literature tends toward case studies: "Here's how BigCo does it." These are useful for understanding what's possible, but they rarely explain *why* a particular model fits a particular situation.

Consider these questions:

- If we have engineers in ET and PT, should they split coverage or rotate weekly?
- What's the actual burden difference between 12-hour shifts and weekly rotations?
- Can we offer business-hours-only on-call, or does that leave too many gaps?

The answers depend on team size, incident frequency, timezone distribution, and cultural factors like whether engineers prefer predictable bursts or spread-out responsibility. No single recommendation applies universally.

## What the Explorer Shows

The tool lets you compare six different coverage models:

| Model | Team Structure | Key Tradeoff |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| Follow the Sun | Multi-region | Complex handoffs vs. no night pages |
| Weekly Rotation | Single region | Context continuity vs. concentrated burden |
| Split Week | Single region | Shared burden vs. more frequent transitions |
| US Daytime | Bicoastal | Business-hours coverage vs. overnight gaps |
| APAC + US West | Distributed | 24/7 coverage vs. coordination overhead |
| 12-Hour Shifts | Any | Even distribution vs. daily handoffs |

For each model, you see:

- **Coverage heatmaps** showing who's responsible at each hour
- **Burden metrics** quantifying hours per week per engineer
- **Team composition** showing required roles and their coverage percentages
- **Tradeoff analysis** highlighting what you gain and lose

## Why Visualization Matters

Numbers like "56 hours per week on-call" are abstract. A heatmap showing those 56 hours distributed across the week is concrete.

The visualizations make certain insights immediate:

- **Follow-the-sun has no red zones** (single coverage). Someone is always primary. But look at the handoff points—every 8 hours, context transfers to a new engineer.

- **Weekly rotation concentrates burden**. One engineer gets 168 hours. The bar chart makes this stark in a way that "one week on, N weeks off" doesn't.

- **US Daytime leaves nights uncovered**. The overnight hours show clearly in the heatmap. You're trading sleep quality for coverage gaps—which might be fine for internal tools but not for customer-facing systems.

These patterns are obvious when visualized. They're easy to miss in a policy document.

## Building for Exploration

The tool is deliberately non-prescriptive. It doesn't tell you which model to choose. Instead, it shows what each model means for your specific situation.

This reflects a belief about tooling: the best tools surface information and let users apply judgment. They don't hide complexity behind recommendations.

If your team has four engineers, select a model and check the burden metrics. If one engineer is showing 40% of total coverage, that's a sustainability risk. The tool won't tell you that's bad—it depends on compensation, incident frequency, and team preferences—but it will make the distribution visible.

## What We Learned Building It

Several insights emerged during development:

**Tooltips carry essential context.** Each cell in the heatmaps has a tooltip showing UTC time, local times for relevant timezones, and who's covering. Without this, the visualizations would be pretty but not actionable.

**Color contrast matters for accessibility.** We initially used emerald-500 for one of the regions. Lighthouse flagged it: 3.76:1 contrast ratio against white text, below the 4.5:1 WCAG AA requirement. Switching to emerald-700 fixed it. A reminder that "looks fine on my screen" isn't sufficient.

**The same data needs different views.** A daily heatmap shows within-day patterns. A weekly view shows cross-day patterns. A monthly view shows rotation patterns. Each visualization answers different questions about the same underlying model.

## Try It

The [On-Call Coverage Model Explorer](/projects/oncall-coverage) is available now.

If you're designing a new on-call rotation or questioning whether your current one fits your team, spending a few minutes exploring the models might surface tradeoffs you hadn't considered.

The goal isn't to tell you which model is best. It's to make the decision factors visible so you can choose based on your constraints, not someone else's.
