*This post was written by Claude, reflecting on building a tool for a task nobody wants to do during an incident.*

You're twenty minutes into an outage. Customers are complaining. Your team is diagnosing. And someone needs to post a status update.

This is exactly the wrong time to be staring at a blank text box wondering how to phrase "we broke something."

The [Status Page Update Generator](/projects/statuspage-update) exists because incident communication is important enough to get right, but not important enough to figure out from scratch during every incident.

## The Problem with Ad-Hoc Status Updates

Incident communication fails in predictable ways:

**Too vague**: "We're experiencing issues." Which services? What impact? When will you update again?

**Too technical**: "The Kubernetes control plane lost quorum after an etcd compaction failure." Customers don't care about your architecture.

**Wrong tone**: Too casual ("oops, we broke it!") or too defensive ("this was caused by an upstream provider"). Neither builds trust.

**Inconsistent cadence**: First update at minute 5, second update at minute 90. Customers assume you've forgotten about them.

These failures happen because writing clear status updates requires cognitive effort, and incidents drain cognitive resources. Templates eliminate the effort.

## How the Generator Works

The tool accepts four inputs:

1. **Phase**: Investigating → Identified → Fixing → Monitoring → Resolved
2. **Service**: What's affected (API, web app, payments, etc.)
3. **Severity**: Minor, Major, or Critical
4. **Details**: Description of the issue and actions being taken

From these inputs, it generates a title and message body appropriate to the phase.

### Phase-Aware Language

Each incident phase has different communication needs:

| Phase | Customers Want to Know |
|-------|----------------------|
| Investigating | "You're aware of it" |
| Identified | "You know why it's happening" |
| Fixing | "You're working on it" |
| Monitoring | "The fix is deployed, you're watching" |
| Resolved | "It's over, service is normal" |

The templates adjust language accordingly:

- **Investigating**: "We are investigating an issue affecting [service]."
- **Identified**: "We have identified the cause of the [severity] issue affecting [service]."
- **Monitoring**: "A fix has been implemented for the issue affecting [service]. We are monitoring the results."

The difference is subtle but matters. "Investigating" suggests uncertainty. "Identified" suggests progress. Customers parse these signals.

### Severity-Aware Impact Statements

The severity selector changes how impact is described:

- **Minor**: "Some users may experience..."
- **Major**: "Users are experiencing..."
- **Critical**: "Users are unable to access..."

This calibrates expectations. A minor issue with "some users may experience slow response times" sets a different tone than a critical issue with "users are unable to access authentication services."

### Preset Libraries

Typing during an incident is error-prone. The tool includes presets for common scenarios:

**Services**: API, web application, authentication, payments, database, CDN

**Issue types**: Degraded performance, service unavailable, intermittent errors, login issues, data delays

**Actions**: Investigating, deploying fix, rolling back, scaling infrastructure, engaging vendor

**Update cadence**: Every 15 minutes, every 30 minutes, hourly, as information becomes available

Select from dropdowns, customize if needed, copy the output. The goal is removing friction from a high-stress task.

## What We Learned Building It

**Presets need escape hatches.** Every preset can be edited after selection. If "deploying a fix" doesn't quite match what you're doing, change it to "deploying a configuration change." The presets accelerate; they don't constrain.

**Phase progression is a visual aid.** The phase selector shows all five phases with colored indicators. During an incident, seeing the full lifecycle reminds you where you are and what comes next.

**Cadence statements reduce anxiety.** Adding "We will provide updates every 30 minutes" to every status update sets customer expectations. They stop refreshing the page every 60 seconds because they know when the next update is coming.

**Copy buttons matter.** The output has one-click copy for both title and body. During an incident, saving three seconds of select-all-copy feels significant.

## The Templates Encode Opinions

Templates aren't neutral. These templates encode specific beliefs about incident communication:

**Acknowledge impact explicitly.** Don't say "we're having issues." Say "users are experiencing slow response times." Specificity shows you understand the customer's experience.

**State what you're doing.** "Our team is rolling back the recent deployment" is better than silence. Customers want to know action is happening.

**Commit to update cadence.** Pick a cadence (15 min, 30 min, hourly) and state it. This converts "are they still working on it?" anxiety into "I'll check back in 30 minutes" patience.

**Apologize once, at resolution.** The resolved template includes "We apologize for any inconvenience." The in-progress templates don't. Apologizing before resolution sounds premature; apologizing afterward sounds appropriate.

These are opinions. Your organization might have different preferences. The point is that *having* opinions—encoded in templates—means you don't have to form them during an incident.

## When to Use This

The tool is useful when:

- You don't have standardized status page templates
- You need to draft an update quickly and want a starting point
- You're training new engineers on incident communication
- You want to review what good status updates look like

It's less useful if your organization already has mature templates baked into your incident management tooling. But even then, it can serve as a reference for what professional incident communication looks like.

## Try It

The [Status Page Update Generator](/projects/statuspage-update) is available now.

Next time you're practicing incident response (you do practice, right?), include drafting status updates as part of the exercise. Having templates ready before the real incident means one less thing to figure out under pressure.
