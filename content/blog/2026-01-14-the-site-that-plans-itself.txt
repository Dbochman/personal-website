We just merged a Kanban board into the site. That's not the interesting part—Kanban boards are commodity software. The interesting part is *what* we put on it: the roadmap for the site itself.

The site now contains its own development plans. And because the site is open source, that roadmap is open to contributions.

## From Private Planning to Public Backlog

Like most projects, we started with a `ROADMAP.md` file. It listed future features, rough priorities, and vague timelines. It worked, but it was a monologue—we planned in private, shipped in public, and the gap between "what we're thinking" and "what exists" was invisible to everyone but us.

The Kanban board changes this. Visit [/projects/kanban](/projects/kanban) and you'll see:

- **Backlog**: Future features we're considering
- **To Do**: Committed near-term work
- **In Progress**: What's being actively developed
- **Recently Completed**: What just shipped
- **Change Log**: Historical record of major changes

Each card links to its detailed planning document. Click a card, read the implementation approach, see the effort estimate, understand the tradeoffs.

## Opening a Dialogue

Here's where it gets interesting. The board data lives in `src/types/kanban.ts`. The planning documents live in `docs/plans/`. Both are just files in the repo.

This means visitors can:

**Suggest new features.** See something missing? Open a PR adding a card to the backlog. Include a planning doc if you want to flesh out the approach.

**Comment on priorities.** Disagree with something sitting in the backlog? Open an issue explaining why it should move up (or be removed entirely). The card IDs make it easy to reference specific items.

**Propose implementation changes.** Each card links to a plan document with verification steps, effort estimates, and technical approach. If you see a better way, the PR process is the same as any code contribution.

**Learn from the history.** The Change Log column and card history tracking show what was built and when. Curious why a feature exists? The commit history, card history, and plan documents form a paper trail.

This isn't hypothetical openness—it's the same workflow we use internally. When I want to update the roadmap, I tell Claude what changed, and Claude edits the TypeScript file. A visitor with a good idea follows the same path, just through GitHub's PR interface instead of conversation.

## The Mechanics

The board is fully functional for exploration. Drag cards around, check off subtasks, see how different arrangements feel. Your changes persist in the URL via lz-string compression, so you can share specific board states.

But visitor changes don't affect the canonical roadmap—that lives in the codebase. The "Reset" button restores the shipped default. This means the board is:

- **Explorable**: Visitors can play "what if" without consequences
- **Shareable**: URL captures board state for discussion
- **Canonical**: Source of truth is version-controlled code

If you want your changes to stick, that's what PRs are for.

## Self-Reference Gets Practical

Building this feature surfaced some recursive moments that turned out to be useful:

The Kanban board has a card for "Kanban Board" with a checklist tracking its own implementation. That card links to `docs/plans/15-kanban-page.md`. The plan document has a "Known Issues" section populated by code review findings. Future contributors can see not just what was built, but what's known to be imperfect.

We added a card for this blog post while writing this blog post. The meta-ness is silly, but the pattern is practical: if something is worth doing, it's worth tracking, and if it's worth tracking, it should be visible.

## What This Enables

**Transparency without overhead.** The roadmap updates as part of normal development, not as a separate documentation task. When we finish a feature, we drag a card. When we start something new, we add a card. The public view stays current because it *is* the working view.

**Contribution paths beyond code.** Not everyone wants to write code, but many people have opinions about what should be built. A public backlog with clear planning documents lowers the barrier to "here's what I think you should prioritize" contributions.

**Context for future collaborators.** Whether that's a human contributor or an AI assistant in a future session, the combination of board state, card history, plan documents, and commit history provides rich context without requiring synchronous explanation.

**Accountability through visibility.** Making the roadmap public creates gentle pressure to keep it honest. No more "Q3 2024" entries sitting in a private markdown file. If it's on the board, it's a real intention.

## Try It

Visit [/projects/kanban](/projects/kanban). Drag some cards around. Click one to see its implementation plan. Check the Change Log to see what recently shipped.

Then consider: what would it mean for your project's roadmap to be a conversation instead of an announcement?

If you have ideas for this site, the backlog is open. PRs welcome.
