# Uptime Monitoring for a Personal Site

I set up external uptime monitoring for my personal website.

The site does not have significant traffic or business impact. The motivation was not risk mitigation. It was consistency. If I claim to care about reliability, the systems I own should reflect that, regardless of scale.

That includes knowing when something is broken before someone tells me.

## Why Monitor a Personal Site

Monitoring is a habit, not just a response to risk.

For production systems, monitoring exists because the cost of undetected failure is high. For personal systems, monitoring exists because the practice of instrumenting and observing systems should be automatic.

The questions are the same at any scale:

- Is the system available?
- How would I know if it was not?
- What does the historical availability look like?
- Where do I look when something seems wrong?

If those questions are not answered for a simple system, they are unlikely to be answered well for a complex one.

## Implementation

I used UptimeRobot. Free tier, five minute check interval, email alerts on failure.

Setup took about five minutes:

- Create account
- Add monitor for the site URL
- Configure alerting
- Link the public status page in the site footer

UptimeRobot also provides a public status page, which shows current status and historical uptime. I linked it from the site footer.

## What This Demonstrates

This is a small example of treating owned systems as production systems.

Specifically, it shows:

- Default toward observability, even when not strictly required
- Preference for external monitoring over assumptions about availability
- Willingness to instrument systems before problems occur
- Use of public status pages as a transparency mechanism

None of this is complex. The value is in the habit of doing it at all.

## Tradeoffs

Five minute check intervals are coarse. For a personal site, that is acceptable. For a production system, I would want faster detection and more sophisticated alerting.

Email alerting is simple but sufficient here. I check email frequently enough that detection to notification latency is reasonable.

If I wanted more coverage, I could add monitors for specific paths like `/blog` or `/runbook.html`, configure response time thresholds, or integrate with Slack. For now, the basic setup is enough.

## Why Include This on a Personal Site

Reliability work often produces artifacts that are invisible until something fails.

A status page is a visible artifact. It shows that monitoring exists, that availability is tracked, and that I default toward operational visibility even for low stakes systems.

For a portfolio meant to represent how I think about reliability, that visibility matters.

## Takeaway

Monitoring is not proportional to importance. It is proportional to ownership.

If a system is worth running, it is worth observing.
