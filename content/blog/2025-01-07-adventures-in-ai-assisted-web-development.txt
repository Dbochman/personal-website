I had been meaning to create a new website to better serve as a professional portfolio—which as an SRE/Reliability/Resilience guy has been interesting. I also wanted to get more familiar with AI tools, and this was a nice small project that was easy to dig into. I started with Lovable for the initial design, focusing on aesthetics and overall structure. I remember using ChatGPT to refine my Lovable prompts and give it more reliability flavor. Once I had Lovable's output in a good place, I exported to GitHub and continued my adventures with Claude Code primarily, with a bit of Codex, for every PR after that.

## The Lovable Phase

Lovable was great for the early exploration. Layout, colors, typography, responsive behavior—I could iterate through ideas quickly just by describing what I wanted. The early commits tell the story: lots of styling tweaks, copy changes, and the occasional "Reverted to commit" when something didn't land right.

Once it felt like *me*, I exported to GitHub and the engineering side began.

## Enter Claude Code

The first couple PRs set the tone for what working with Claude Code would be like:

- **PR #1**: Found and fixed a toast listener memory leak I hadn't even noticed
- **PR #2**: Set up the whole Vitest testing infrastructure

From there, Claude Code (and occasionally Codex) handled feature work, testing, performance tuning, and the monitoring setup. The blog you're reading now came from PRs #54-56—three focused PRs that included tests, TypeScript types, and proper SEO. More structure than I'd probably have done on my own.

## A Debugging Story

Here's one that sticks with me. The blog's MDX loader wasn't working—Vite's MDX plugin was processing files before the raw import could grab them, so I kept getting React components instead of strings.

Claude Code tried a bunch of fixes: different `import.meta.glob` configurations, renaming files from `.mdx` to `.md`, various import strategies. Nothing worked. After a few rounds I finally asked: "Is there not some other filetype we could use to avoid all this?"

Obvious in hindsight: just use `.txt` files. No plugin touches `.txt`. Three small edits and it worked.

That's kind of how the collaboration goes—Claude Code grinds through the implementation attempts, and I ask the dumb questions that occasionally turn out to be the right ones.

## What Stuck With Me

**Lovable is great for the fuzzy stuff.** Exploring visual directions through conversation beats writing CSS when you're still figuring out what you want.

**Claude Code adds rigor I wouldn't.** Every PR came with tests, error handling, edge case coverage. The repo has 123 tests now. I would not have written 123 tests.

**Timing the handoff matters.** Export from Lovable once the visuals feel settled. Too early and you're doing design work in the wrong tool.

**Context helps a lot.** I added a CLAUDE.md file explaining the project structure and it noticeably improved how well Claude Code's output fit with existing code.

## Where It Landed

- 200+ commits
- 123 tests
- 95/100 Lighthouse performance
- Monitoring, CI/CD, automated deploys

The site does what I needed it to do. And I came out the other side actually comfortable building with these tools—which was kind of the point.
