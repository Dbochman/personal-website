# Building This Site with AI Tools

I built this site using AI development tools. [Lovable](https://lovable.dev) for the initial design and structure, [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) and some for everything after that.

The goal was not just to ship a website. It was to understand how these tools actually fit into a development workflow. A portfolio site was a reasonable scope for my experiment.

## Why This Approach

AI tools are easy to demo and hard to evaluate. Most examples are either trivially simple or carefully curated. I wanted to understand the friction, the handoffs, and the failure modes.

A personal website provided:

- Low stakes if something went wrong
- Enough complexity to encounter real problems
- A concrete artifact to show for the effort

The result is a site I can point to and say: this is what AI assisted development actually looked like for me.

## Working with Lovable

[Lovable](https://lovable.dev) handled visual exploration. Layout, typography, color, responsive behavior. I could iterate through design ideas by describing what I wanted rather than writing CSS.

At one point I asked Lovable to audit the codebase and suggest improvements. The response was more structured than I expected:

> Let me first check the detailed audit and refactoring plan to understand the critical issues that need to be addressed.

It identified that the main Index component had grown to 364 lines and proposed breaking it into focused components. After implementing the changes:

> ✅ Critical Issues Resolved:
> 1. Data Layer Extraction - Created centralized data management in /src/data/ with TypeScript interfaces
> 2. Component Decomposition - Broke down the 364-line monolithic Index.tsx into 8 focused components (83% size reduction)
> 3. Separation of Concerns - Established clear boundaries between layout, content, and data layers

The refactoring left each component under 100 lines with a single responsibility. That level of systematic improvement from a conversational prompt was unexpected.

I also used ChatGPT to refine my Lovable prompts and push the aesthetic toward something that felt more like a reliability engineering portfolio.

Once the design felt settled, I exported to GitHub. Every PR after that went through Claude Code, sometimes with Codex.

## What Claude Code Did Well

The first two PRs set expectations:

- PR #1 found and fixed a toast listener memory leak I had missed
- PR #2 set up the entire testing infrastructure with Vitest and React Testing Library

From there, Claude Code handled feature work, performance tuning, and monitoring setup. The blog system came from three focused PRs with tests, TypeScript types, and SEO implementation.

The repository now has 123 tests. I would not have written that many on my own.

## Where Judgment Was Still Required

AI tools do not eliminate the need for direction. They shift it.

One example: the blog content loader was not working. Vite's MDX plugin processed files before the raw import could access them, returning React components instead of strings.

Claude Code tried several fixes. Different glob configurations, renaming files from `.mdx` to `.md`, various import strategies. None worked.

After a few rounds I asked whether we could use a different file extension entirely. The answer was obvious once stated: use `.txt` files. No plugin processes `.txt`. Three edits and it worked.

The pattern repeated throughout. Claude Code handles implementation. I ask questions and make decisions about direction.

## Outcomes

This site is a concrete example of working with AI tools on a real project.

Specifically, it shows:

- How to divide work between tools based on what each does well
- When to hand off from design tooling to engineering tooling
- How to maintain code quality with AI assistance
- Where human judgment remains essential

The site shipped with 200+ commits, 123 tests, 95/100 Lighthouse performance, and a monitoring stack. That outcome reflects both what the tools contributed and the decisions I made along the way.

## Takeaway

AI tools are useful. They are not autonomous.

The value is not in replacing judgment. It is in accelerating the mechanical work so that judgment can be applied more often and more carefully.
